# Food-Delivery

1: I created a food delivery app to capitalize on the growing demand for convenient food ordering and delivery services, provide a solution to streamline the process for both customers and restaurants, and tap into the potential revenue stream offered by the food delivery industry.


2:Additionally,I created a food delivery app allows me to leverage technology to enhance user experience, offer various features such as order tracking and payment options, and potentially disrupt traditional food delivery models.
